# Wrapper for the "crossdirect" compilation method.
# pmbootstrap mounts the native chroot in the foreign arch (e.g. armhf) chroot
# as /native. This package gets installed into the native chroot, and creates
# wrappers like:
#
# /native/usr/lib/crossdirect/armhf/gcc
# -> /native/usr/bin/armv6-alpine-linux-muslgnueabihf-gcc
#
# When building packages in the armhf chroot, PATH will get prepended with
# "/native/usr/lib/crossdirect/armhf". The end game is of course invoking the
# cross compiler from the native chroot, running at native speed, whenever
# calling the compiler from the foreign arch chroot. See crossdirect.c for
# implementation details (llvm, fakeroot, rpath).
